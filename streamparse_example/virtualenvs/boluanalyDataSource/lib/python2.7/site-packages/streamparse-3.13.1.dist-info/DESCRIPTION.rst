|Build Status|

Streamparse lets you run Python code against real-time streams of data via
Apache Storm.  With streamparse you can create Storm bolts and spouts in
Python without having to write a single line of Java.  It also provides handy
CLI utilities for managing Storm clusters and projects.

The Storm/streamparse combo can be viewed as a more robust alternative to Python
worker-and-queue systems, as might be built atop frameworks like Celery and RQ.
It offers a way to do "real-time map/reduce style computation" against live
streams of data. It can also be a powerful way to scale long-running, highly
parallel Python processes in production.
